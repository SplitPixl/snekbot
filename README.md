# snekbot! :snake:

### What is snekbot?
Snekbot started out as a joke between me and some friends long ago when I was first starting out on bot development. I was looking to learn more languages and thought "Snek? Snekbot. Let's use python!". So I did. This is the simple bot that resulted.

### How do I get?
You can get snekbot on Discord or Telegram [here](https://snek.splitpixl.xyz). Or you can download this and host your own version!

### How can I help?
Feel free to create issues for bugs and features. If you want to actually add code to this bot, submit a Pull Request and bug me to review it.

### License
Snekbot uses the MIT License. Feel free to edit stuff and make it your own, but provide credit where it came from.

### I have too much money.
I wish I had that problem, If you feel like throwing money at me I've got a [patreon](https://patreon.com/snekbot).
